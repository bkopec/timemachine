    <h1>The first working time machine</h1>
    <p>This website brings you the first time machine that actually works.
        Built by a 16T parameters biological neural network trained on hundreds of trillions of tokens,
        it can transport users through time to almost any desired date desired using javascript and a GET request</p>
    <p>This comes with one tiny side effect : you will come into a timeline where the whole world, including carbon isotopes, will have united in an observable universe wide conspiracy in making you believe
        that you are actually still in the past.</p>
        <p>THIS MACHINE HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN NOT TO WORK, USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION</p>
<div>
    <label for="year">Travel to year</label>
    <input type="number" id="year" min="2026" step="1"/>
    <button onclick="getTimeline()">Get to timeline</button>
